Thanks to Roman Korkikian for basic source code found in ZeroNights2013, which helped me in my researches.

My researches are done for Master Thesis and are based on improving error correction and attacking DES implementation with input masking is included.

To build project run in linux terminal:

g++ main.cpp des.cpp tables.cpp attack.cpp -fopenmp -o des -lm
